## üß© Components and Setup


### üîç 1. Splunk (SIEM)

**Goal**: Collect, index, and correlate logs from various sources.

#### Setup:
```bash
wget -O splunk.deb 'https://download.splunk.com/...'
dpkg -i splunk.deb
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

#### Configuration:
- Forward logs via Syslog from Wazuh, Zeek, endpoints.
- Configure inputs in `inputs.conf`.
- Create custom alert rules (e.g., high SSH login failures).
- Define indexes and sourcetypes.

#### Example alert:
- SSH brute force (triggered by 10+ failed logins within 60s)

---

### üõ° 2. Wazuh (EDR / HIDS)

**Goal**: Monitor and analyze system activity on endpoints.

#### Setup:
- Deploy Wazuh manager and dashboard on a server.
- Install Wazuh agents on endpoints.

#### Example agent install:
```bash
curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

#### Configuration:
- Enable modules: `syscheck`, `rootcheck`, `auth`, `firewalld`
- Link logs to Splunk via **Filebeat** (alerts.json) or **direct forwarding via Syslog or Wazuh‚Äôs native Splunk module**.

#### Use cases:
- Unauthorized sudo access
- Suspicious file changes
- Bruteforce SSH attempts

---

### ‚ö° 3. Shuffle (SOAR)

**Goal**: Automate response to Splunk alerts using workflows.

#### Setup:
- Deploy Shuffle via Docker:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle.git
cd Shuffle
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Configuration:
- Create API keys for integration with Splunk.
- Build workflows: parse alert ‚Üí block IP (e.g., via IPTables) ‚Üí notify team.

#### Example workflow:
- Receive Splunk alert
- Extract attacker IP
- Execute remote SSH command to block IP on firewall
- Send email to SOC

---

### üìä 4. Zabbix (Monitoring)

**Goal**: Monitor service uptime, system performance, and resource usage.

#### Setup:
- Deploy Zabbix server and web interface
- Install Zabbix agents on all hosts

#### Configuration:
- Host templates: Linux OS, SSH service
- Triggers: memory usage, CPU load, service down

---

### üåê 5. Zeek (Network Analysis)

**Goal**: Passively monitor and log network activity for forensic analysis.

#### Setup:
```bash
apt install zeek
zeekctl deploy
```

#### Logs:
- `conn.log`, `ssh.log`, `http.log`, `dns.log`
- Forwarded to Splunk via Filebeat or manually ingested

#### Use case:
- Detect SSH brute force or scan based on abnormal traffic behavior

---

### üì• 6. Syslog Server (Log Centralization)

**Goal**: Collect logs from various hosts and forward them to Splunk.

#### Setup:
- Use **rsyslog** or **syslog-ng** as the log collection service.
- Configure listeners on **port 514/UDP** for incoming Syslog traffic.
- Forward collected logs to the **Splunk ingestion port** (via TCP/UDP or HTTP Event Collector depending on configuration).

#### Example (rsyslog forwarding):
Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` or `/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf`:
`*.* @<splunk_ip>:514`

- Restart rsyslog: `sudo systemctl restart rsyslog`

#### Notes:
- Ensure firewall rules allow traffic on port 514.
- Logs can be tagged by source/host for better indexing in Splunk.


---

### üõ† 7. OpenVAS (Vulnerability Scanner)

**Goal**: Identify and report system and network vulnerabilities.

#### Setup:
- `sudo apt install openvas`
- `sudo gvm-setup`

#### Usage:
- Schedule scans on internal subnets.
- Export reports for SOC analysis.
- Classify risks: CVEs, outdated services, weak configurations.

---

### üïµÔ∏è 8. Autopsy (Forensics)

**Goal**: Investigate compromised systems and analyze disk-level evidence.

#### Setup:
- Download and install **Autopsy** on a forensic workstation.
- Acquire disk image from the suspected machine.

#### Features:
- File recovery and timeline analysis.
- Browser history and deleted file tracing.
- Supports evidence preservation and incident reporting.

## üß™ Attack Scenarios Simulated

### Scenario 1: SSH Brute-force Attack
- Tool: `hydra`
- Impact: Excessive login attempts
- Detection: Wazuh (auth.log), Zeek (connection count), Splunk alert
- Response: IP blocked by Shuffle, email sent to analyst

### Scenario 2: Port Scanning
- Tool: `nmap`
- Detection: Zeek (`conn.log`), alert in Splunk
- Response: Visualized in dashboard, IP tagged in logs

---

## ‚úÖ Lessons Learned

- Centralized logging and normalization are essential for alert correlation.
- SOAR automation reduces manual workload.
- Combining host-based (Wazuh) and network-based (Zeek) monitoring increases visibility.
- Splunk‚Äôs alert flexibility is key for SOC responsiveness.
- Regular scanning with OpenVAS helps in proactive hardening.
- Autopsy enables post-compromise analysis for deeper understanding.
